## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Git
- A terminal emulator

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/joryeugene/prompthive
cd prompthive

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/prompthive

# Install dependencies and build
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- help

# Run specific command
cargo run -- new test-prompt "This is a test"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run integration tests only
cargo test --test '*'

# Run with coverage (requires cargo-tarpaulin)
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

## Style Guide

### Rust Code Style

We follow standard Rust conventions:
- Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- Follow `cargo clippy` suggestions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Document public APIs

**Example:**
```rust
/// Creates a new prompt with the given name and content
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `name` - The name of the prompt
/// * `content` - The prompt content
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<()>` - Success or error
pub fn create_prompt(name: &str, content: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:
```
feat: add new variable system
fix: resolve parsing error in templates
docs: update installation instructions
test: add tests for compose command
refactor: simplify prompt storage logic
perf: optimize search performance
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add inline documentation for public functions
- Include examples in documentation
- Keep language clear and concise

## Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions
2. **Integration Tests** - Test command workflows
3. **Performance Tests** - Verify <80ms operations
4. **Doc Tests** - Ensure examples work

### Writing Tests
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_prompt_creation() {
        let result = create_prompt("test", "content");
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_performance() {
        let start = std::time::Instant::now();
        let _ = list_prompts();
        assert!(start.elapsed().as_millis() < 80);
    }
}
```

## Community Prompt Packs

### Creating a Prompt Pack

1. **Structure your repository:**
```
awesome-prompts-coding/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api-design.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database-schema.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ error-handling.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component-design.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ state-management.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit-tests.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration-tests.md
```

2. **Add metadata to prompts:**
```markdown
---
name: api-design
description: Design REST APIs following best practices
variables:
  - resource: The resource name
  - operations: CRUD operations needed
tags: [backend, api, rest]
---

Design a REST API for {resource} supporting {operations}...
```

3. **Create clear README:**
```markdown
# Awesome Coding Prompts

A collection of prompts for software development.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR/awesome-prompts-coding
ph import ./awesome-prompts-coding
```

## Prompts Included
- `backend/api-design` - REST API design
